# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## Required Environment Variables for Email

Add these in **Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables**:

```
EMAIL_USER=start@alecsdesign.xyz
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. For Namecheap Private Email (Current Setup)

**SMTP Settings:**
- Host: mail.privateemail.com
- Port: 587
- Security: STARTTLS

**Credentials:**
- EMAIL_USER: Your full email (e.g., start@alecsdesign.xyz)
- EMAIL_PASSWORD: Your email account password

**Note:** No app-specific password needed for Namecheap

### 2. Add to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - Key: `EMAIL_USER` → Value: `start@alecsdesign.xyz`
   - Key: `EMAIL_PASSWORD` → Value: `your-namecheap-email-password`
4. Apply to: Production, Preview, Development
5. Redeploy (or trigger redeploy after adding vars)

### 3. Other Email Providers (If Needed)

**Gmail:**
```
host: 'smtp.gmail.com'
port: 587
Requires App Password (not regular password)
```

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```
host: 'smtp-mail.outlook.com'
port: 587
```

**Yahoo:**
```
host: 'smtp.mail.yahoo.com'
port: 587
```

**To change provider:** Update `host` in `/app/api/submit-email/route.ts`

## How It Works

When users submit their email on the /upgrade page:
1. Email is sent FROM: EMAIL_USER (your Gmail)
2. Email is sent TO: start@alecsdesign.xyz
3. Email contains user's submitted email address

**Note:** EMAIL_USER is only used as the SMTP sender account. 
All notifications go to start@alecsdesign.xyz

When a user clicks "Voglio Essere Avvisato al Lancio":
1. Form sends email to `/api/submit-email`
2. Vercel serverless function uses nodemailer
3. Sends email to YOUR email address with user's email
4. HTML formatted with all details
5. Fails silently if error (user always sees success)

## Testing Locally

Add to `.env.local`:
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

Then run `npm run dev` and test the form.
